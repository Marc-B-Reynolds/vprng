               **vprng <small>vectorized pseudo random number generator</small>**


!!! TIP
    Alpha version library and documentation. WIP


NOTE: this is a [markdeep](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/) document and will render funky in the GitHub preview.

Overview
==============================================================

This is a single file header that implements two *vectorized* pseduo-random number generators [PRNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator).  The primary goal of both is to be *fast* on widely available hardware while having high statistical randomness quality. I'll try to provide enough information and some supporting tools to allow for customization and for independent validation of statistical quality.

The intended default target is middle-ground: not the fastest possible nor attempting to complete with *state-of-the-art*.

* for speed we have 4 shifts and 2 products on the path to the result
* for statisitical quality 10 (repeatable) runs of `PractRand` on power-of-two input sizes from 1MB to 512GB only produce 1 *unusual* XXXXX

The implementation is mostly *C99* with a sprinkling of *C11* (currently `<stdatomic.>` but I should add some `static_assert`). More importantly instead of using architecture specific intrinsics the code uses the GCC `vector_size` extension for accessing SIMD operations.

Required 256-bit SIMD (for "full" speed) hardware operations:
* 64-bit addition
* 64-bit shift by constant (same for all four lanes)
* 32-bit product (low 32-bit result)
  
If all targets have hardware 64-bit products then that's game changer which I'll note some examples in the implementation details below and there are example custom configuration headers.

The default base generators (`vprng`) provide:
* easy paramterization of approaching $2^{62}$ unique generators
* each of which has a period of $2^{64}$
* *apparently* passes `PractRand` with inputs up to 512GB (maximum size tested). Test run outputs can be found in the `C/tools/data` directory

The second set of generators (`cvprng`) simply extend with a second state which:
* increases the period to: $2^{64}\left(2^{64}-1\right) \approx 2^{128}$
* increases statistical randomness properties

Also there's no attempt at being a feature rich library and only provides initialiation and basic uniform output routines.

# Basic usage

Like almost all *single header file* libraries you simple include the header and in exactly one source file define the macro `#define VPRNG_IMPLEMENTATION` prior to inclusion. However if any compile-time configuration is used some wrapper header should be used instead to ensure the same configuration is used everywhere. The repository has example wrapper headers:

| header     |    |
|:---        |:---|
|vprng.h     | baseline header   |
|vpcg.h      | 64-bit product state update and mixer  |
|vsplitmix.h | 64-bit product mixer  |

However my expection this is more interesting as a reference version (for other languages) and/or development and testing bed.


## API

As mentioned the number of exposed functions is quite small so let's run through these before digging into the internal design.


### Data types

Since we're working with SIMD operations we need to define some basic SIMD types using the `vector_size` extension:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ c
typedef uint32_t u32x8_t __attribute__ ((vector_size(32)));
typedef uint64_t u64x4_t __attribute__ ((vector_size(32)));
typedef float    f32x8_t __attribute__ ((vector_size(32)));
typedef double   f64x4_t __attribute__ ((vector_size(32)));
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 


### Global functions 

We need an easy mechanism to create unique generators and provide that by simply using an `atomic` counter. The counter is mapped to a candidate value which may be rejected and in that case we rinse-and-repeat until an acceptiable value is found. The details are described in this [blog post](https://marc-b-reynolds.github.io/math/2024/12/11/LCGAddConst.html) but the TL;DR version is the expected number of candidates inspected is $1.03388$ (almost no rejections). Also each general needs four constants.

As mentioned the underlaying counter is accessed atomically (including the pair of global functions) but there is no code to block the global functions while some other thread is create a generator. This seems like make-work to support an undesirable code structuring that doesn't even seem useful.

---------------------

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ c
void     vprng_global_id_set(uint64_t id)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

Sets the global position to `id`.

!!! TIP
   The postion is only 63 bits (top ignored), the counter increments at least four times per generator and there may be rejections which further increment the counter. See comments above and code examples below.

<br>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ c
uint64_t vprng_global_id_get(void)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

Returns the current global position.  The function `vprng_id_get` returns the accepted global position used by the first 64-bit state update slot of the inputed generator.

---------------------
Examples:


This is foo

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ c
void some_startup(void)
{
  vprng_id_set(prng_id);    // prng_id loaded from previous run

  // initialize all PRNGs

  prng_id = vprng_id_get(); // save prng_id for next run
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[Listing [pairty]: Unique per run initialization]


As noted the creation of a new generator via `vprng_init` or `cvprng_init` walks XX

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ c
vprng_t prng;

vprng_global_id_set(1);

// prints: 6,10,15,19,23,27,32,36,40,43
for(uint32_t i=0; i<10; i++) {
  vprng_init(&prng);
  printf("%lu,", vprng_global_id_get());
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



#### Generator managment functions

---------------------

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ c
void vprng_init (vprng_t*  prng)
void cvprng_init(cvprng_t* prng)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

Initializes `prng` to a new unique generator: creates a set of four additive constants and initializes the state to logical position zero in its stream.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ c
uint64_t vprng_id_get (vprng_t*  prng)
uint64_t cvprng_id_get(cvprng_t* prng)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

Returns the value of the global position used by the state update of slot zero.

Implementation details

Here I'm trying to provide details on how it works, why some choices were made and there are tons of self notes.

## possible extensions

1. With hardware 64-bit products we can move to 64-bit [LCGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator) (SEE: `vpcg.h`). This adds one product to the state update path and doesn't change the path to result.
2. While attempting an 8 wide 32-bit LCGs might be tempting it also presents a few problems. First it would require creating a modified additive constant generator (simple). More importantly it would require specialized 32-bit finalizer for `vprng` results to preserve uniformity and `cvprng` should keep a 64-bit finalizer. Again this isn't difficult but I think attempting to inprove the bit finalizer would be a better engineering and testing time commitment.

## additive constant initialization

Is as mentioned a mod of this [blog post](ttps://marc-b-reynolds.github.io/math/2024/12/11/LCGAddConst.html) which is based on the assumption of a strong bit finalizer.  Here base versions (without 64-bit products or specialize hardward ops) currently have a weak finalizer. This might improve but without some speed sacrifices will never be great. The current mod is simply changing to a well known sequence constant instead of an ad-hoc.  At some total number of generators possible reduction this could be further improved at minimal cost.  Mainly thinking about putting constaints on the top bits. Skim: 

* thinking of the additive constant (let's call it $k$ here) as $\alpha = k/2^{64}$ which is approximating *some* irrational number.
* disc

This is lower priority that working on the bit finalizer.


## fixed generator

If the macro `VPRNG_HIGHLANDER` is set then parameterized generators are disabled and in that case we use a fixed set of additive constants. I'll assume the state update is a Weyl sequence since the choice is much less important for LCGs. However for both Weyl and LCG we want values that are promising as an integer multiplicative step as discussed in the post on runtime generation.

[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Quasirandom Sequences](https://extremelearning.com.au/unreasonable-effectiveness-of-quasirandom-sequences/)

(skim goals here)

* co-primes:

An obvious thing to try which I think has little value. 

* Moebius transformation

$$
\alpha' = \frac{p\alpha+q}{r\alpha+a}
$$




#  Second state

The second set of generators `cvprng` simply add a second state update to form a combined generator. This code is structure such that the first state is either an integer additive recurrent (Weyl sequence) or a linear congruential generator. 


## XorShift <small>two term</small>

The default second state update is the two term [XorShift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xorshift) presented by Richard Brent ([#XorShift1] equation 4). Brent is using row vectors in the paper and this is rewritten using column vectors:

$$
T = \left(I+R^9\right)\left(I+L^7\right)
$$

This is virtually unknown because (as noted by Brent) it has a *"zeroland"* problem which means that it tends to map low population count input to low population count output which makes it a very bad random number generator.

Specifically if `p0 = popcount(x)` and `p1 = popcount(mix(x))` then $p_1 \le 4~p_0$.



## XorShift <small>three term</small>

The standard notion of an XorShift is the three term version create by George Marsaglia which can be enabled in the default header (`vprng.h`) via `#define VPRNG_CVPRNG_3TERM`.  This adds one xorshift to the second state update path without effecting the path to the result.

Some properties of these were examined by François Panneton in his thesis ([#XorShift2] type I generators in Chapter 8) which is in French. The part we're interested in is after he's reduced the candidate set down to examining a sub-set of the possible forms (in matrix notation):

$$
X_1 = \left(I+L^c\right)\left(I+R^b\right)\left(I+L^a\right) \\
X_2 = \left(I+L^a\right)\left(I+R^b\right)\left(I+L^c\right) \\
X_5 = \left(I+R^b\right)\left(I+L^c\right)\left(I+L^a\right)
$$

reduced the number of shift defining triples $\left(a,b,c\right)$ and has computed goodness of equidistribtion measure. This last is skimmed in the English paper [#XorShift3] where it is called ${\Delta}_1$  Good values are small where the ideal is zero. Since we're using an *XorShift* as merely a state update and not directly as a PRNG the remaining properties explored are of little interest. 

$ x' = X_2~x = \left(I+L^a\right)\left(I+R^b\right)\left(I+L^c\right)x $

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ c
 x = x ^ (x << c); // (I+L^c)x
 x = x ^ (x >> b); // (I+R^b)(I+L^c)x
 x = x ^ (x << a); // (I+L^a)(I+R^b)(I+L^c)x

## XorShift <small>zeroland</small>

Since we've reduced the candidate set with information from [#XorShift2] let's refine Brent's population count information. Let's define the *escape time* to be the number of steps it takes for some initial value $x_0$ to reach having a popcount of at least 16. Then compute the mean and standard deviation of escape times of all values with a given population count. Here's all the
